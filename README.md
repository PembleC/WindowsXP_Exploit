# WindowsXP_Exploit
Project for CS 373 - Defense Against the Dark Arts  

You will need a windows xp iso to create the VM: "en_winxp_home_x86_build2600.iso"

I used a python script to create a .m3u file that crashes the RealPlayer software due to stack overflow. 
I used python instead of perl and Immunity Debugger with the Mona plugin, rather than Metasploit.

This is similar to the well know exploitation done by the corelan team:
